				+ "\r\n\r\nEvery enemy you hit gets a focus meter. Each hit you land adds to it - a "
				+ "melee swing a full point, an arrow, bolt or thrown weapon half, a bullet or "
				+ "explosive a quarter - and it drains steadily from the moment of the last hit. "
				+ "While it is up, your hits on that enemy are worth more: they do more damage, add "
				+ "more towards knocking it down, dismember more often, and a knockdown can become a "
				+ "full ragdoll. Every bonus is a percentage per point, read off the meter as it "
				+ "stood before the hit, so the first hit of a chain earns nothing and every hit "
				+ "after it earns off the ones before. Five hits in a row are worth more than five "
				+ "hits over a minute."
				+ "\r\n\r\nThe game has a meter of its own that runs the other way: vanilla's pain "
				+ "meter fills as a zombie takes hits and, once full enough, lets it attack straight "
				+ "through yours and shrug off the slow that a flinch would cause. That stays in force "
				+ "until the focus meter reaches the break point, 3 by default: below it the zombie "
				+ "gets tougher exactly as in vanilla and the hits you land to build the meter are "
				+ "landed at risk; at it the zombie breaks, its pain meter is held down, every hit "
				+ "flinches it for the full animation and it cannot attack through - for as long as "
				+ "you keep the meter up there. 'wl break {points}' sets the break point (0 breaks it "
				+ "from the first hit); 'wl break off' leaves the vanilla pain meter alone and keeps "
				+ "only the bonuses here."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl' on its own prints the settings and changes nothing - it is the status "
				+ "read, so it is safe to type when you only want to look. Each line names the "
				+ "command that changes it, so the settings block is also the menu."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl on' and 'wl off' are the master switch. With it off every hook returns "
				+ "immediately: no meter, no bonuses, and the vanilla pain meter runs as normal. "
				+ "Saying which state you want rather than toggling it means the command reads the "
				+ "same whichever state you were in, and repeating it is harmless. 'wl zombies' and "
				+ "'wl animals' work the same way."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl zombies on|off' covers everything the game flags as a zombie - zombies, "
				+ "zombie dogs, vultures, Undead Legacy's own - and bandits. On by default. 'wl animals "
				+ "on|off' adds hostile animals: bears, wolves, boars, mountain lions. Off by default, "
				+ "since a bear you can break so it stops attacking through is a different animal."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl weights {melee} {archery} {gun}' sets the points one hit adds by what "
				+ "landed it: 1, 0.5 and 0.25 by default. Archery covers bows, crossbows and anything "
				+ "thrown; gun covers guns, launchers and explosives. A thrown spear carries the same "
				+ "item as a held one and counts as melee. Turrets, drones, traps, vehicles, and burns "
				+ "or bleeds count for nothing and earn nothing, whoever set them up."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl cap {points}' is the most the meter holds, 5 by default, and 'wl decay "
				+ "{per sec}' is how fast it drains, 0.2 a second by default, the same rate as the vanilla pain meter - "
				+ "so a full meter is gone 25 seconds after the last hit."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl bonus {stun} {dismember} {damage} {ragdoll}' sets the four payoffs, each "
				+ "a percentage per meter point: 20, 15, 5 and 15 by default. Stun is extra knockdown "
				+ "build-up per hit, as a share of the hit's damage, split between body and legs the way "
				+ "the game splits it. Dismember multiplies the weapon's dismember chance - and a head "
				+ "dismember is a kill, so this one is strong. Damage scales the hit itself, before "
				+ "armour. Ragdoll is the chance a knockdown the game would have played as an animated "
				+ "fall becomes a physics ragdoll instead. At a full meter of 5 that is double the "
				+ "knockdown build-up, 1.75x the dismember chance, 1.25x damage and a 75% ragdoll. 0 "
				+ "switches any one of them off."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl door {pct} {min}' is the DoorSlammer interaction: a door slammed on a "
				+ "zombie whose meter is at least {min} points knocks it down {pct} percent per point, "
				+ "20 and 1 by default, so a zombie you have hit four times goes down four slams in "
				+ "five. The ragdoll roll above applies to that knockdown too. The slam then counts as "
				+ "one melee hit. Needs DoorSlammer installed and the flavor switch on in both mods."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl flavor' lists the extra behaviour supported mods offer, one switch per "
				+ "mod, all on by default, and changes nothing. 'wl flavor {mod}' toggles one of them, "
				+ "by the other mod's command name - 'wl flavor ds' - and 'wl flavor on' or 'wl flavor "
				+ "off' sets them all. A switch does nothing unless that mod is installed. Each pair "
				+ "of mods is switched on both sides, and toggling it in either one sets both, so 'wl "
				+ "flavor ds' and 'ds flavor wl' are the same switch. A mod this build does not know "
				+ "about is let through until you switch it off; it gets a line of its own here once "
				+ "it has been seen."
				+ "\r\n\r\nIn multiplayer each machine works out its own hits and keeps its own copy of "
				+ "every meter, fed by the same damage traffic the server sees, so the settings on the "
				+ "machine that swung the weapon are the ones that apply to that swing. Keep them the "
				+ "same everywhere."
				+ "\r\n\r\nEvery setting here takes effect immediately and is written straight to a "
				+ "settings file, so it survives a restart - and survives updating the mod, because "
				+ "the file lives in the game's user data folder next to Saves rather than in Mods. "
				+ "'wl info' prints its full path. It is plain 'key = value' text and can be edited "
				+ "by hand with the game closed; a line that will not parse is ignored rather than "
				+ "fatal, and deleting the file goes back to the built-in defaults in Settings.cs."
				+ "\r\n\r\n'wl info' prints the same block with the patch state and the counters "
				+ "added. The key line is 'hits': the startup log only proves the hooks were "
				+ "installed, that number proves hits are reaching them. 'peak meter seen' shows how "
				+ "high a meter has climbed so far.\r\n\r\n'wl reset' zeroes the counters so one "
				+ "scenario can be measured on its own; live meters are left alone.\r\n\r\n'whacklash' "
				+ "is an alias for 'wl'.";
